### Helpers

- <span class="badge text-danger-emphasis bg-danger-subtle">Breaking</span> **Ratio helpers have been replaced by the [aspect ratio utility](/docs/5.3/utilities/aspect-ratio/).**
  - Custom ratios via CSS variable are no longer supported, but you can still use the `$aspect-ratios` Sass map to customize the available ratios.
  - The `.ratio-*` utilities no longer apply to a parent wrapperâ€”instead, place them directly on the element you want to modify.
